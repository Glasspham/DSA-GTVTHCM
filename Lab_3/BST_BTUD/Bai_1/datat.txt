For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over the many mysteries of 
Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument that took an estimated 1,500 years to erect. Located 
on Salisbury Plain in southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright 
stones placed in a circular layout.
Archaeologists believe England's most iconic prehistoric ruin was built in several stages, 
with the earliest constructed 5,000 or more years ago. First, Neolithic* Britons used 
primitive tools, which may have been fashioned out of deer antlers, to dig a massive circular 
ditch and bank, or henge. Deep pits dating back to that era and located within the circle may 
have once held a ring of timber posts, according to some scholars.
